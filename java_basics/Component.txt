I explain it to you about the main(), but related attached components are also to be cleared with 
it. It is the method and the starting point for JVM to start the execution of a Java program. 
Without this method, JVM will not execute the program and the syntax of the main() method is 
written like.

public static void main(String args[]) //static method
public: It is an access specifier. You should use a public keyword before the main() method so 
that JVM can identify the execution point of the program. If you use private, protected, and 
default before the main() method, it will not be visible to JVM.

static: You can make a method static by using the keyword static. You should call the main() 
method without creating an object. Static methods are the method that invokes without creating 
the objects, so you do not need any object to call the main() method.

void: In Java, every method has the return type. The void keyword acknowledges the compiler 
that the main() method does not return any value.

main(): It is a default signature that is predefined in the JVM. It is called by JVM to execute a 
program line by line and end the execution after completion of this method. You can also 
overload the main() method.

String args[]: The main() method also accepts some data from the user. It accepts a group of 
strings, which is called a string array. It is used to hold the command line arguments in the form
 of string values.

Here, agrs[] is the array name, and it is of String type. It means that it can store a group of string. 
Remember, this array can also store a group of numbers but in the form of string only. Values 
passed to the main() method is called arguments. These arguments are stored into args[] array,
 so the name args[] is generally used for it.

I hope I was able to answer your question to your satisfaction. Let me know if there is anything 
else I can do.
