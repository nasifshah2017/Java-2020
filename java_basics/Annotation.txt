I hope you will get it after knowing that the "Annotations" are used to provide supplemental information about a program. It is a tag that represents the "metadata" i.e. attached with class, interface, methods, or fields to indicate some additional information that can be used by java compiler and JVM.

Annotations in Java are used to provide additional information, so it is an alternative option for XML and Java marker interfaces.

The following explanation will show you what it behaves in the program.

1.   Annotations start with ‘@’.

2.   Annotations do not change the action of a compiled program.

3.  Annotations do not change the action of a compiled program.

4.  Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by the compiler. See the below code for example.filter_none

There are several built-in annotations in Java. Some annotations are applied to Java code and some to other annotations.

Built-in Java Annotations used in Java code

@Override

@SuppressWarnings

@Deprecated

Built-in Java Annotations used in other annotations

@Target

@Retention

@Inherited

@Documented

I hope I was able to answer your question to your satisfaction. Let me know if there is anything else I can do.
